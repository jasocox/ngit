- There are two stashes, the first one is a poor attempt at config
  enhancements.  Should mostly just try again. Also, some of the refactors are
  good, but should be done independent of the new feature

- Need to refactor the command executiong code. Make it only have one place to escape.

- Need to write unit tests

- Need to make the git repo only about ngit, and make another one for random small node projects

- Need to rename ngit to something unused and more definitive.

- Need to move the scrum board out
