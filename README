I am rewritting all of my tiny, useful scripts in node.js. I've been tired or
writing them in bash for some time, however, I haven't found a good
replacement. I've never enjoyed writing tiny scripts in pyton or ruby. Python,
because I've never really gotten into it, and I have way too many languages I
want to learn that are a higher priority. Ruby, because I find the startup time
way too long for a 10 line script.

The pilot script I am starting with is my git flow management script that is
getting unwieldy. I was trying to add something relatively simple: rolling back
Rails migrations before switching to another branch.  When trying to write it,
bash did nothing but get in the way. I am thoroughly excited to get this
working, since many of the things I want to automate, I deal with many times
every day. There are many more possibilities that I haven't even considered,
since I knew how much of a pain it would be to get it right.

Here is the blog I read that started this inspiration:
